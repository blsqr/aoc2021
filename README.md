# Advent of Code 2021
This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).


## Setup
1. Clone repository
2. *(optional)* Create a virtual Python 3 environment and activate it
3. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` 


## Computing solutions
There is a small CLI that takes care of invoking the corresponding scripts with correct file path arguments:

```
python solve_puzzle.py <day> <part>
```
